On March 28, 2025, at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) defeated Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs in a dominant IPL 2025 performance. RCB set a strong foundation by scoring 196/7 in their 20 overs. Rajat Patidar starred with the bat, smashing a quick 78 off 45 balls. He was well supported by Faf du Plessis, who scored 38, and Glenn Maxwell, who added 32 runs to help RCB post a challenging total.
<br/><br/>CSK's bowlers found it difficult to contain the aggressive RCB batting lineup, and their fielding lacked intensity, allowing RCB to capitalize on key moments.
<br/><br/>In the chase, CSK never found momentum, losing early wickets and struggling to build partnerships. Although MS Dhoni tried to revive the innings with a fighting 30 off 16 balls, it wasn’t enough to turn the tide. CSK eventually ended at 146/8 in their 20 overs, falling well short of the target.
<br/><br/>RCB’s bowlers executed their plans effectively, maintaining pressure throughout and never letting CSK into the game. This win was a historic one for RCB as it marked their first victory at Chepauk since 2008.
